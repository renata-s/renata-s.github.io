#### Restaurant Review App-Stage 1

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project a static webpage converted to a mobile-ready web application. The design customized to be responsive on different sized displays and accessible for screen reader use. Also added a ServiceWorker script to cache requests to all of the siteâ€™s assets so that any page that has been visited by a user will be accessible when the user is offline.
